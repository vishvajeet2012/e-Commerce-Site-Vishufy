# e-Commerce-Site-Vishufy

This is an e-commerce website project called Vishufy.

# React + Vite

This project uses the React framework with Vite for faster development and performance. Vite provides a minimal setup to get React working efficiently with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some useful ESLint rules.

## Plugins Used

Currently, two official plugins are available for this setup:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh, an alternative to Babel.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
